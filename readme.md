# API Readme

## Email Validation API

This API provides a simple and straightforward way to validate email addresses. It utilizes the Flask framework for web development and the `validate_email` library to check the validity of email addresses. This README will guide you on how to set up and use the API.

### Prerequisites

Before you can use this API, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- validate_email

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors validate_email
```

### Usage

1. Clone or download the repository containing the API code to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the API code is located.

3. Run the API by executing the following command:

```bash
python your_api_file.py
```

Replace `your_api_file.py` with the name of your Python file containing the API code.

4. Once the API is running, you can use it to validate email addresses. The API has a single endpoint:

   - **Endpoint**: `/validate_email`
   - **HTTP Method**: GET

   You can use this endpoint to check whether an email address is valid. The email address to be validated should be included in the URL as a query parameter. Here's an example URL:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/validate_email?email=example@example.com
   ```

   Replace `example@example.com` with the email address you want to validate.

5. Send a GET request to the API endpoint using your preferred method (e.g., browser, Postman, or cURL).

6. The API will respond with a JSON object that includes the email address and its validation status:

   - If the email address is valid, you will receive a response like this:

     ```json
     {
       "email": "example@example.com",
       "is_valid": true
     }
     ```

   - If the email address is invalid, you will receive a response like this:

     ```json
     {
       "email": "example@example.com",
       "is_valid": false
     }
     ```

   - If there is an error during the validation process, you will receive an error response like this:

     ```json
     {
       "email": "example@example.com",
       "error": "Error message"
     }
     ```

### Example

Here's an example of how you can use the API with Python's `requests` library:

```python
import requests

email = "example@example.com"
url = f"http://localhost:5000/validate_email?email={email}"

response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    result = response.json()
    if result["is_valid"]:
        print(f"The email address {email} is valid.")
    else:
        print(f"The email address {email} is invalid.")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.json()['error']}")
```

### Error Handling

If you encounter any errors while using the API, check the error message provided in the response for more information about the issue.

### Deployment

To deploy this API in a production environment, consider using a web server such as Gunicorn or uWSGI and a reverse proxy like Nginx. Ensure that you configure the server to serve the API securely over HTTPS.

### Security

Make sure to implement proper security measures to protect the API from potential attacks, such as rate limiting, input validation, and authentication if required.
